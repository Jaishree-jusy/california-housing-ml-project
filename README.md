# california-housing-ml-project
This project uses the California Housing Dataset to predict median house prices based on various socio-economic and geographical features. It applies data preprocessing, visualization, and multiple machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict housing prices efficiently.
he project focuses on key steps of a machine learning workflow — data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature scaling, model training, and evaluation. Several regression models are implemented, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Regressors.

Each model is trained and evaluated based on performance metrics like R² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to identify the most accurate approach for predicting housing prices.

The results show that ensemble models such as the Random Forest Regressor achieve higher accuracy and generalization performance compared to traditional linear models.

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real-world data for predictive analytics, helping understand the relationship between economic and geographical factors and housing prices.
